This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Router Dom v6: unexpected behavior when navigating to incorrect paths. The bug results in a blank screen or no rendering due to typos in route paths, incorrect use of the useParams hook, or the absence of a default route. The solution involves correcting path typos, ensuring accurate useParams usage, and adding a default route to catch invalid paths.
