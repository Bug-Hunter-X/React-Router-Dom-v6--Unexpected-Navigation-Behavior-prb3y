In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating to a route that doesn't exist or when the path is incorrectly defined. This leads to unexpected behavior, often resulting in no rendering or a blank screen.  The issue frequently stems from typos in the route path, incorrect usage of the `useParams` hook, or forgetting to define a default route using the `Route` component with the '*' path.
